# ARPG Project
It is a showcase project which shows our skills on Game Development. We would like to consider this project as one level AA Game Project. Developed with Unreal Engine 5
Current models and animations bought from UEMarketplace to start the project according to our perspective.

## Currently working on:

- Cleaning the code structure.

## Future Update:

- Refactor Codes
- More VFX
- Custom Animations
- Main Menu
- Save Game
- Weapon Mechanics
- We will add more...

We are using Blender for modeling our custom characters, Autodesk Maya for custom animations and Adobe Illustrator for UI elements.

Target Construction of the Project:
- 2 Different game option. 
- One of them will be wave defense, so player can check the combat design or just beat AI mindlessly.
- The other one will be one level game mode which will have scripted in-game cutscenes such as flying spaceships, talking characters etc.
- One level game mode will have both stealth and combat actions. We will try to work to give the player a choice.
- Our approach on combat design was inspired from Devil May Cry 5 but we will try to add more features from Batman/Spider-Man and Souls series.
